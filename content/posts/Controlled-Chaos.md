# Controlled Chaos
*19.04.2023 | 09 Magis, 991 P.A*

## A long strange day.
The group was woken up by a band of goblins trying to approach and steal from them, after a short and explosive fight the field had their small corpses spread all over it. 

Hayley prepared breakfast for the party before they continued their journey east, for some hours it all seemed like a normal day before Cleeve, Stonehand and Eluin heard a faint scream that approached rapidly, their heads turned too the skies to watch a Dwarf plummet like a meteor into the ground. They stopped to inspect the poor guy which was dressed in black and blue robes and had strange scorch marks on the body and clothes. 
Eluin used a spell to stop the body from decomposing, hoping to find someone to ressurrect him in Frostshire. 

Later the day they spotted smoke in the distance, they approached what seemed to be a small community with farmers. A barn was caught on fire and people were rushing to put it out, with their limited water supply they could not get control over the flames.
Hayley had the idea of turning into a Mammoth and use a cup they found earlier which had a magical supply of water in it, and spray water on the fire.
As she approached the fire, it lunged at her Mammoth form and set her on fire, a fight ensued with a fire elemental. 
After the party was set on fire, extuingished both themselves and the barn they talked too the farmers for a while, learning the meteor dwarf name was Finnegan.
In the ashes of the fire, Hayley and Eluin found a small spellbook of another Wizard, who seemingly was very fond of Fire.

## A weirdly long strange day
As the group went on their way from the farmer community, they spent some time reading and enjoying the view as they ventured into the forest.
After a while they heard the sound of large flapping wings, wind that made the few leaves left on the tree's fall off, and for a moment they saw a large massive black dragon travelling east.
It was only there for a few seconds before Cleeve sent Cirdirom up, who was promptly shot at as he peaked the sides of the road.

An ambush took place in the forest, where two large Ogre's, and several Orcs attacking the party as they tried to get through too Frostshire. 

After taking care of the ambush, the party continued on to the Cold Plains where they set up camp for the night.
