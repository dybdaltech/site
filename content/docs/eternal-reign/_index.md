# Eternal Reign
The Eternal Reign storyline started when the heroes from Grimhollow set their goal towards the east, the ruins of Harrowheart. The journey towards Harrowheart took several weeks where they stopped a fanatic Ogre and his followers, uncowered strange allies and dangerous foes. During their journey it slowly progressed towards winter times in Nordia.

Stories from the journey can be found under **posts**.

I made this mostly with Photoshop, Gazlo Mountain brushes and exported buildings from [Watabou medieval city generator](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator)

The map changed a lot over the course of the campaign:
